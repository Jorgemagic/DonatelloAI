# TripoAI.NET

[TripoAI](https://www.tripo3d.ai) offers a cutting-edge [API-Rest](https://platform.tripo3d.ai/docs/introduction) that seamlessly integrates AI-generated models into your applications or tools. With its initial version released just last March, we're witnessing just the beginning of its potential.

I've developed a desktop tool leveraging TripoAI's service alongside [Evergine](https://evergine.com/) to put the platform through its paces. This tool allows users to input prompts and instantly generate multiple 3D models complete with textures and materials. It's a game-changer for those in need of free 3D models to prototype their scene creations.
