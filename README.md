# Donatello AI

"Imagine being able to type anything and generate a 3D model within seconds."

_DonatelloAI_ name not only pays homage to the famous Italian sculptor Donatello but also reflects its integration with artificial intelligence, symbolizing a fusion of traditional craftsmanship and modern technology

I've developed a desktop tool leveraging __[TripoAI's service](https://platform.tripo3d.ai/docs/introduction)__ alongside __[Evergine](https://evergine.com/)__ to put the platform through its paces. This tool allows users to input prompts and instantly generate multiple 3D models complete with textures and materials.

## Features

- Text to 3D
- Image or Sketch to 3D
- AutoRig and animating generated models
- Stylization
- Optimized models and export to multiple formats GLTF, USDZ, FBX, OBJ, STL.
- Model Gallery
- Compose large scenes with generated models
